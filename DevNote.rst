as of 2021.0505
code the master branch is mostly reflecting of v1_classic_cli (ie, for running as bofhbot).
Though for regular use of bofhbot.py, latest code is at rest_draft_plan fd22ec4 tagged as v1.1_regUseBofhbot

To run bot check | bot suggest from Nick, checkout v2_rest+client
(or just run the stuff under Nick's repo, https://github.com/nicolaschan/bofhbot )
